## The environment Used

Windows 10
Visual Studio Code 1.63.2 (user setup)

## Steps to run Python code with Visual Studio Code: 

1. If Python is not installed then [Download Python installer](https://www.python.org/downloads/) from it's website and install it.
  
2. Check the Python Lang version by opening a terminal and type `py -3 --version` (in windows).
3. Open Visual Studio Code and go to extention. Search for Python by Microsoft and install it.
4. Create `hello_world.py` in VS code and write the following code

    ```
        print("Hello! Python world!!")
    ```

5. open a terminal `CTRL+`` and execute the following command `hello_world.py`. Also you can do it easily by Right-clicking anywhere in the editor window and select Run Python File in Terminal. I found [this article](https://code.visualstudio.com/docspython/python-tutorial) very helpful.
   
6. Also [code runner extention](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.code-runner) for visual studionis a good choice for running Python codes in VS Code.
